# Lag-exploit-anti-predict-for-weave-su-v2
This method is very crutchy and there may be predictive errors.

But this does not prevent the aimbot from hitting normally during a peak or other situations.
To do this, you need to:
Redo the brick of the lc in such a way that it works as a fake.
That is, as with a regular fake flag, a timer is made
Until it reaches 14 ticks , we do not send data (we encrypt)
Reached - we send the data to the server (we create a shift)
